# PistonCore — TASKS.md

**Status:** Living document — single active task file. Update at the end of every session.
**Last Updated:** Session 74 — FULL FRONTEND CODE ↔ SPEC AUDIT (all 12 frontend JS files read
end-to-end against the specs and this gap list). Outcomes: (1) NEW HIGH gaps filed:
GAP-S74-1 (top-level trigger/condition/restriction commit/edit seam broken — the wizard
cannot write to the top-level arrays the compiler reads; new bundle W-S18) and GAP-S74-2
(action commit writes ALL entity_ids with no domain filter; task `domain` derived from
`finalIds[0]` can emit wrong ha_service). (2) Open gaps re-diagnosed from code:
GAP-S71-3 (import role-map keys off retired `device_map`), GAP-S73-1 (mechanism confirmed
with line numbers — verify-first step DONE), GAP-S71-2 (one missing `'devices'` map entry +
a wider plural blind spot, GAP-S74-3), GAP-S70-1 (verification answered: it IS a defect —
attribute-blind re-resolution), GAP-S69-2 (re-pointed at the current-format edit seam),
GAP-S69-4 (narrowed — conditions/tasks now covered in code). (3) New MED/LOW gaps:
GAP-S74-4 (Snapshot export is still v1 — strips nothing but device_map), GAP-S74-5
(time-condition shape: spec vs commit vs hydrate three-way mismatch), GAP-S74-6
(only_on_days 0–6 vs ISO 1–7), GAP-S74-7 (`list_role` alive on for_each, undocumented),
GAP-S74-8 (stale-comment cluster contradicting the load-bearing rule), GAP-S74-9 (small
render defects). (4) New spec-corrections bundle D-S5d capturing the Session 74 spec-file
audit (stale SAMPLE_PISTONS, PISTON_FORMAT minimal example, S3-1 checklist refs,
PENDING/COMPLETE contradiction sweep, FRONTEND_SPEC staleness, PROGRESS_TRACKER retirement).
Also VERIFIED GOOD in code: GAP-S72-1 fix coherent across all three files; `_globalsCache`
strip/restore; sel.tokens all-entity-ids guardrail; union-then-intersect incl. per-field
intersection; operator/command vocabularies match WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK §5.

Prior: Session 73 — (1) Spec reconciliation: the task/with-block specs were
rewritten to match the CODE (the older specs had drifted behind in-code fixes). New
authoritative spec WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md written; PISTON_FORMAT (2.4),
STATEMENT_TYPES (2.3), WIZARD_SPEC (2.7) reconciled. (2) GAP-S72-1 CODED (partial — see
W-S15): the with-block now stacks tasks instead of overwriting. Root cause was deeper than
filed — clicking a task line resolved to null (`_findAnyNode` doesn't search `tasks[]`), so
task EDIT was a dead path; `_route` always read `tasks[0]`; `_saveDeviceCmd` wrote
`tasks:[newTask]`. Fixed across editor.js (task-owner attr + click resolves to owning action
node, passes task-id), wizard-core.js (edit the clicked task, record edit_task_id), and
wizard-action.js (append/replace by id, preserve siblings, Add-more stacks into same block).
(3) New gap found: GAP-S73-1 — global editor can't remove a missing/failed HA device.
(4) Tonight's "No devices could be resolved" symptom traced to HA/Unraid updates breaking
the Sonos media_player entity feed (HA-side, not a PistonCore code bug); Jeremy switched
`@Speakers` to a ReSpeaker and it still won't pull — picker/resolution is a separate gap
(GAP-S73-2). NOTE: the GAP-S72-1 code is untestable end-to-end until the picker populates.

Prior context: Session 72 closed GAP-S71-1 (global resolution in action wizard — resolvers
now read `Editor.getGlobalsCache()`; `_globalsCache` no longer leaks into saved JSON).
Session 71 closed B-0 (backend v2). Session 70 closed W-S11 (first lossless round-trip).
Session 69 full spec reconciliation.

## How to Use This File

- **One active task file.** All open gaps and fixes live here, grouped into session
  bundles so related bugs get fixed together instead of scattering across sessions.
- **Completed work moves to TASKS_HISTORY.md.** When a whole bundle or gap is fully done,
  move it out. Keep this file scannable.
- **Partial fixes stay here.** If a session fixes part of a gap, the done part goes to
  history; the open remainder stays in this file with a note.
- **Groups are stable; order flexes.** Jeremy fixes what's in front of him. When a new
  problem appears mid-session, log it into the right group and push the planned session
  back a slot. Don't reshuffle the groups — just reorder when they run.
- **New gaps:** assign every new gap to a group before the session closes. Never leave one
  unassigned. Format: `GAP-SXX-N`.

**Per-session discipline (from CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md):**
- Read all listed files before writing anything. Do not write code without permission.
- Show proposed changes as text for approval before writing files.
- Deliver complete file replacements, not diffs.
- Fix what the user can see first.
- At session end: move completed items to TASKS_HISTORY.md; roll partial fixes' remainders
  forward; log any new gaps into a group.

## The Goal Before Everything Else

**Clean round-trip on a simple piston:**
wizard writes JSON → backend saves it → compiler reads it → frontend renders it correctly →
deploy to HA → manual trigger fires.

### What "S3-1 passes" means — concrete checklist
S3-1 is not done until every item below verifies with one simple real piston (built fresh
in the wizard; SAMPLE_PISTONS.md is old-format until regenerated at D-S6 — see D-S5d):
1. Wizard builds the piston from scratch, no manual JSON edits — including its TRIGGER in
   the top-level `triggers` array (requires W-S18).
2. Save round-trips cleanly: close, reopen, every node renders identically. No "Unknown
   statement" placeholders, no missing nodes.
3. Edit one node (e.g. change a device). Save. Round-trip again. Identical except the change.
4. Compile target detected correctly as `native_script`.
5. Test Compile output matches YAML hand-verified at D-S6 against the final JSON
   (COMPILER_SPEC.md is FROZEN/STALE — do not use its current examples as the oracle),
   normalized whitespace.
6. Deploy succeeds, no HA reload errors.
7. Manual trigger fires; PISTONCORE_RUN_COMPLETE event received and surfaced.

All seven. Partial passes are gaps, not victories.

## ⭐ The Load-Bearing Rule (read before any wizard/editor/compiler work)

If this breaks, nothing works — the editor just shows pretty text that compiles to nothing.

- **Variables and globals store device NAMES (friendly names), never entity IDs.** The
  friendly name is the lookup key — it's how HA returns the device's entity IDs. A variable
  is a device list; entity IDs are pulled live from HA when used.
- **Nodes store entity IDs** — the attribute-bearing entity, one per device, for the chosen
  function. (Illuminance condition on 2 devices → 2 `*_illuminance` entity IDs. Not battery,
  not motion.)
- **Resolution happens at the node, at commit**, because the same variable can feed
  different attributes in different statements.
- **Only nodes hold entity IDs. Variables/globals never do. One rule, no exceptions.**

## W-S15 — Action Wizard Fixes

**Files:** wizard-action.js, wizard-core.js, wizard-variable.js, editor.js,
WIZARD_SPEC.md, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

- **SPEAK_ACTION_SPEC.md holds the TTS spec for editor + compiler.** GAP-S72-1 (the
multi-task with-block foundation) is done in code; Speak rides on it.

- **GAP-S71-1 ✅ CLOSED (Session 72):** Global resolution in action wizard fixed.
  `_getFlatEntityIds` and `_getGroupedEntityIdsForTokens` now read from
  `Editor.getGlobalsCache()` (loaded at editor-open time) instead of `_deviceData_globals`
  (which was never populated in the edit flow). `Editor.getGlobalsCache()` exposed on the
  Editor public API alongside `getPistonVariables()`. Also fixed `_globalsCache` leaking
  into saved piston JSON — editor.js restores the cache after backend response reassignment.
  Files changed: editor.js, wizard-core.js, wizard-action.js.

- **GAP-S72-1 (multi-task with-block — HIGH) — CODED Session 73, NEEDS VERIFY:**
  The with-block now stacks tasks instead of overwriting. The bug was deeper than filed:
  clicking a task line resolved to null (`_findAnyNode` doesn't search `tasks[]`) so task
  EDIT did nothing; `_route` always read `tasks[0]`; `_saveDeviceCmd` wrote `tasks:[newTask]`.
  Fix landed across three files (full replacements in Session 73 outputs):
  - **editor.js** — task line carries `task-owner` (parent action id); a task click resolves
    to the owning action node and passes the clicked `task-id` to the wizard.
  - **wizard-core.js** — `_route` edits the task matching `extra['task-id']` (not `tasks[0]`);
    records `_sel.edit_task_id`.
  - **wizard-action.js** — `_saveDeviceCmd` appends/replaces the task by id, preserves
    sibling tasks; "Add more" re-targets the same block so tasks stack.
  **Remainder still open (rolled forward):**
  - **GAP-S72-1b (UX, picker-adjacent):** "+ add a new task" on an EXISTING block forces a
    device re-pick (the add-task path has no `editNode`, so the device picker resets). The
    code is safe (CASE 1 appends to the existing block regardless), but the user shouldn't
    re-select devices the block already has. Fix = pre-fill the device picker from the block
    on `'task'`-context entry. Do this WITH the picker work (GAP-S73-2) — same code area.
  - **VERIFY:** untestable end-to-end until the picker populates (GAP-S73-2). Once resolution
    is healthy, confirm: add 2nd/3rd task stacks; edit middle task edits only it; delete one
    keeps the rest (delete path not yet built — see WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md §3.3).

- **GAP-S73-2 (picker / device resolution — HIGH, NEW Session 73):** The action command
  picker shows "No devices could be resolved" even after switching `@Speakers` to a device
  that is NOT the broken Sonos (a ReSpeaker). Tonight's trigger was HA/Unraid updates
  breaking the Sonos `media_player` entity feed (HA-side), BUT the failure persisting after
  switching devices indicates a real resolution/picker bug, not only the missing entity.
  This is its OWN session, and must be debugged against a HEALTHY HA (entities flowing).
  Do NOT conflate with GAP-S72-1. Owns: `_goCommandPicker`, `_goActionDevicePicker`,
  `_getGroupedEntityIdsForTokens`, `_getFlatEntityIds`, globals/variable resolution, and the
  GAP-S72-1b device-picker pre-fill above. Files: wizard-action.js, wizard-core.js, editor.js.
  **Session 74 leads to check FIRST (found in code review, may explain it without live HA):**
  (a) GAP-S74-3 — both resolvers filter piston variables by `v.var_type === 'device'`
  EXACTLY (wizard-core.js ~301, ~361); a `devices`-plural variable resolves to NOTHING.
  (b) Friendly-name match requires the stored name to equal the COMPUTED group label
  (shortest friendly_name in the device_id group, wizard-core.js ~211) — an HA update that
  renames/adds/drops an entity in the group changes the label and silently breaks every
  stored reference to it. (c) Globals resolution reads `g.value || g.initial_value` and does
  not type-check — fine — but the global PICKER lists only `g.var_type === 'device'`
  (wizard-action.js ~96), so a global typed anything else disappears from the list entirely.

- **GAP-S74-2 (action commit violates the load-bearing rule — HIGH, NEW Session 74):**
  CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT claims W-S11 closed the attribute/domain-bearing resolution for
  "conditions/actions/for_each." TRUE for conditions (`_capEntityMap`), FALSE for actions:
  `_saveDeviceCmd` (wizard-action.js ~750–793) writes ALL resolved entity_ids to the node
  with no command/domain filter — its own comments contradict each other (~748 says
  "only ids whose domain can perform this service"; ~764 says "No domain filtering here";
  the code does the latter). Worse, the task's `domain` is derived from
  `finalIds[0].split('.')[0]` — order-dependent — so a multi-entity device (e.g. Sonos =
  media_player + battery sensor) can commit `domain:'sensor'`, `ha_service:'sensor.volume_set'`.
  Fix direction: filter committed entity_ids to entities whose domain supports the chosen
  service (the service-intersection step already knows this), and derive `domain` from the
  chosen service's owning domain, never from `finalIds[0]`. Also correct the
  CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT W-S11 claim to conditions-only (D-S5d item 1).
  Files: wizard-action.js, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md.

- **GAP-S74-3 (`devices` plural var_type blind spot — MED, NEW Session 74):** The spec
  (PISTON_FORMAT variable table) documents `device`/`devices` as valid var_types; the code
  implements ONLY singular `'device'` in: both resolvers (wizard-core.js ~301, ~361), the
  action picker (wizard-action.js ~93–97), the for_each picker (wizard-loops.js ~57,
  ~184–186), and the re-resolve trigger (editor.js ~1196). A `devices`-typed variable
  (e.g. imported `Door_locks`) shows in no picker and resolves to nothing. DECISION NEEDED
  (Jeremy): either retire `devices` (spec edit + import normalization `devices`→`device`)
  or support it everywhere (change every filter to `['device','devices'].includes(...)`).
  Retiring is simpler and matches what the wizard writes. Subsumes the resolver half of
  GAP-S71-2 below. Files: wizard-core.js, wizard-action.js, wizard-loops.js, editor.js,
  wizard-variable.js, PISTON_FORMAT.md.

- **GAP-S71-2 (variable edit dialog — wrong type, MED) — DIAGNOSED Session 74:** editing a
  device variable with var_type `devices` opens with the type dropdown set to "Dynamic".
  Cause found: `VAR_TYPE_DISPLAY` (wizard-variable.js ~20–28) has `'device'` but no
  `'devices'` entry, so plural fails to normalize and the select falls back to the first
  option. One-line fix once the GAP-S74-3 decision is made (add the map entry, or normalize
  plural→singular on hydrate). File: wizard-variable.js.

- **GAP-S70-1 (`_reResolveVariableUses` — MOVED from DEFERRED, upgraded to DEFECT,
  Session 74):** Verification is done from code — it WILL violate the load-bearing rule.
  The function (editor.js ~1352–1402) re-resolves nodes via attribute-blind
  `_getFlatEntityIds(tokens)`, writing the ENTIRE entity cluster back onto condition nodes
  whose entity_ids were attribute-filtered at commit (silently undoing the W-S11 fix on
  every device-variable edit). Also: the documented `newEntityIds` parameter is never used
  in the body (stale signature), and the trigger (editor.js ~1196) only fires for
  `var_type === 'device'` (GAP-S74-3 again). Fix direction: re-resolve per-node using the
  node's own `attribute` (conditions) / task service domain (actions, after GAP-S74-2) —
  i.e. reuse the `_capEntityMap`-style attribute-bearing resolution, not the flat fallback.
  Files: editor.js, wizard-core.js.

- **GAP-S73-1 (global editor can't remove a missing device — HIGH structural) —
  VERIFY-FIRST DONE (Session 74), ready to code:** The GAP doc's live-match hypothesis is
  confirmed against globals.js, with the exact mechanism: (a) picker rows are rendered ONLY
  from live-resolved HA device groups (`_filteredDevices` → `_renderDeviceRows`,
  globals.js ~376–384), so a stored friendly name with no live match has no row to click
  off; (b) "Deselect All" deletes only VISIBLE devices from the selection set
  (`visible.forEach(d => selected.delete(d.friendly_name))`, ~292–297), so unresolvable
  entries survive it — exactly the observed "remove all did not work"; (c) bonus: the
  legacy entity_id→name conversion (~242–253) silently DROPS unresolvable entries from the
  selection while leaving them in the stored value, so old-format globals show a misleading
  count. Fix per GAP_global_editor_missing_device_removal.md: render stored-but-unresolvable
  entries as `⚠ Sonos Bedroom` (⚠ flag immediately before the stored friendly name) as
  flagged removable rows; make Deselect All clear the entire selection set unconditionally,
  not just visible rows. Flagged rows survive open/close untouched — they resolve
  automatically if the device comes back. Only deliberate user action (clicking to deselect
  or Deselect All) removes them. Same ⚠ treatment applies to the piston define variable
  picker (wizard-variable.js) for device/devices type variables — same root cause, same fix.
  **Scope note:** This is the only structural missing-device problem. Entity_ids stored
  directly on condition/action/for_each nodes are stable HA identifiers — a device going
  offline does not change its entity_id, it just becomes unavailable. HA handles unavailable
  entities gracefully at runtime and won't crash on deploy.
  **Deploy warning (add to debug/compile page):** At compile/deploy time, if any entity_id
  on any node is not currently found in HA state, show a passive informational notice on the
  debug screen — not a block: "This piston references one or more devices currently
  unavailable in HA. It will not fire correctly until those devices are restored or replaced."
  Name the specific nodes and stored values. Deploy succeeds regardless — HA won't error.
  Files: globals.js (primary), wizard-variable.js (define picker, same fix), debug page.

- **GAP-S45-1 (cosmetic):** set_variable wizard doesn't normalize `$` prefix.

## ✅ SESSION 73 OUTPUT REVIEW — DONE (consolidation review)

The Session 73 outputs were reviewed against the conversation context and the CODE (source
of truth). Findings:
- **Code (editor.js / wizard-core.js / wizard-action.js):** GAP-S72-1 fix traced end-to-end
  and verified consistent across all three files (task-owner threading → edit-by-task-id →
  append/replace-by-id). Logically correct; still untestable end-to-end until the picker
  populates (GAP-S73-2). No code changes needed.
- **WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md:** the task discriminator was mis-framed as an unresolved
  ASSUMED storage decision ("Claude invented it, override freely"). Corrected: the three-way
  WebCoRE picker category (all-devices / emulated / location) is the authoritative VISIBLE
  requirement (§5.2); the JSON representation is an internal coding-time choice, not Jeremy's
  call and not an open spec question. §2.3, §3.4, §6, §7 reframed accordingly.
- **WIZARD_SPEC.md W-6:** confirmed it references the framework for the model/bug rationale
  and does not restate a competing discriminator; one cross-reference tightened.
- **COMPILER_DECISIONS_HOLDING.md (NEW):** created to preserve the at-risk SPEAK/NOTIFY
  compiler decisions (Speak volume-as-separate-step, compile-time engine, cache default,
  SSML passthrough; Notify stable-target-ref + template-by-kind + service-registry fetch)
  before they're lost to the frozen compiler specs. Retire at D-S6.
- **GAP_global_editor_missing_device_removal.md:** fix direction is still a structural read,
  not yet confirmed against the global-editor code — verify before fixing (unchanged).

Spec files are now safe to treat as reference.
**Session 74 amendment:** the audit found two spec CLAIMS that are wrong against code and
must be downgraded (see W-S18 and GAP-S74-2): "triggers/conditions/restrictions confirmed
against editor.js" (render/delete side only — the wizard cannot write them) and "W-S11
closed for actions" (conditions only). Tracked in D-S5d.

---

## W-S18 — Top-Level Trigger / Condition / Restriction Seam  ← NEW (Session 74) — HIGH, BLOCKS S3-1

**The single biggest finding of the Session 74 code audit.** The spec model (PISTON_FORMAT
Trigger/Condition/Restriction Storage; compiler reads `_piston.triggers` directly) is only
HALF implemented: the editor RENDERS the top-level arrays and can DELETE from them, and
`insertStatement` HAS routing for them (editor.js ~1179–1187) — but the wizard can never
reach that routing. Until this is fixed, **no wizard-built piston can compile with any
triggers at all** (the compiler reads an array the wizard cannot populate).

- **GAP-S74-1 (HIGH — the seam):** Verified flow:
  1. The "only when" ghost passes context `'trigger_or_condition'` with NO block-id
     (editor.js ~286); the restrictions ghost passes `'restriction'` (~268).
  2. `_commitCondition` (wizard-condition.js ~769–792) routes ONLY `if_condition` and
     `trigger_or_condition`+blockId. Every other context falls into the else branch, which
     **wraps the condition in a brand-new `if` node and inserts it as a statement.** The
     if-node matches no array branch in `insertStatement` → lands in `_piston.statements`.
     Result: adding a trigger from the top-level section creates an if-block in the action
     tree, writes nothing to `_piston.triggers`, and doesn't even appear in the section it
     was added from.
  3. `insertStatement` has **no `'restriction'` branch at all** — nothing anywhere writes
     `_piston.restrictions`.
  4. **Edit is worse:** clicking a top-level trigger/condition opens context
     `'edit_condition'` (`_openWizardForEdit`, editor.js ~745); `_commitCondition`'s else
     branch wraps the EDITED condition in a NEW if-block with a NEW id → a duplicate
     appears in the action tree and the original array entry is never updated. This is the
     most likely real face of GAP-S69-2.
  **Fix direction (verify in session):** `_commitCondition` routes by context —
  `'trigger_or_condition'` (no blockId) → bare condition node to
  `insertStatement('trigger'|'condition', node)` by `is_trigger(op)`; `'restriction'` →
  new `insertStatement` restriction branch writing `_piston.restrictions`;
  `'edit_condition'` → replace-by-id in whichever top-level array holds the node (helper
  parallel to `_replaceCondition` for the three arrays). Do NOT wrap in an if-node for any
  of these. Keep the existing if_condition flow untouched (it is correct and verified).

- **GAP-S74-5 (MED — time-condition shape, same code area):** Three-way mismatch.
  Spec (PISTON_FORMAT Time Condition): `subject:"time"`, `value_from`/`value_to`, preset
  objects, ISO `only_on_days`. Code commit (`_buildConditionNode`, wizard-condition.js
  ~859–931): `role:'time'`, NO `subject` field, start value in `display_value`/
  `compiled_value`, end in `value_to`. Code hydrate (`_route`, wizard-core.js ~561–567)
  expects `subject` to be an OBJECT (`subject.type`, `subject.entity_id`) — a shape
  matching neither, so a spec-shaped time condition (imported alarm piston, SAMPLE_PISTONS)
  mis-hydrates as a device condition. Also `wiz-subj-time` input is collected but never
  written to the node (vestigial). DECISION: pick ONE shape (recommend: keep the code's
  flat shape, add `value_from`, update PISTON_FORMAT/STATEMENT_TYPES; delete the dead
  subject-object hydrate branch), then make commit + hydrate + spec agree.
  Files: wizard-condition.js, wizard-core.js, PISTON_FORMAT.md, STATEMENT_TYPES.md.

**Files:** wizard-condition.js, wizard-core.js, editor.js, PISTON_FORMAT.md,
STATEMENT_TYPES.md, DESIGN.md, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md
**Ordering note:** can be coded before or after GAP-S73-2 — it does not need live HA to
fix or to verify (build a trigger, inspect the saved JSON). It DOES block S3-1 item 4–7.

## W-S19 — Frontend Missing Features (spec complete, ready to code)

These are features that are fully specced but not yet built in the frontend. None are in the
editor canvas (that is WIZARD_SPEC.md territory) — these are screen-level gaps.

**Files:** editor.js, list.js, status.js, index.html, style.css, FRONTEND_SPEC.md, TASKS.md

- **GAP-S75-1 (HIGH) — Help system not built:** `GET /api/help/{filename}` endpoint missing.
  Help modal with tabbed markdown rendering not built. `[? Help]` button absent from piston
  list header. Help links absent from debug/compile panel. Help files (`/pistoncore-userdata/help/*.md`)
  not created with default content. Full spec: FRONTEND_SPEC.md Help System section.
  Files: backend `api.py`, frontend `list.js`, `status.js`, `index.html`.

- **GAP-S75-2 (HIGH) — PyScript notice on debug panel not built:** When `compile_target` is
  `"pyscript"` on the saved piston wrapper, the Test Compile panel must show a prominent notice
  above the compiled output. Currently nothing is shown. The notice must link to the `pyscript.md`
  help tab. Full spec: FRONTEND_SPEC.md Help System → PyScript Notice section.
  Files: `status.js`.

- **GAP-S75-3 (MED) — PyScript indicator in editor not updated:** The editor's PyScript
  Requirement Indicator currently detects PyScript-only statements by inspecting statement types
  in the editor — this logic belongs in the backend. After W-S18 lands, the editor should read
  `compile_target` off the returned piston wrapper (set by the backend on save) and show the
  indicator from that field, not from its own statement-type inspection. Full spec:
  FRONTEND_SPEC.md PyScript Requirement Indicator section. Files: `editor.js`.

- **GAP-S75-4 (MED) — `[? Help]` link absent from Test Compile panel header:** Small addition —
  `[? Help]` button in the Test Compile panel header that opens the Help modal to `compiler.md`.
  Full spec: FRONTEND_SPEC.md Test Compile Panel section. Files: `status.js`.

- **GAP-S75-5 (LOW) — location command field names wrong in `_saveLocationCmd`:** Four branches
  write `devices: ['Location']` instead of `role: 'Location'`, `role_tokens: ['__location__']`,
  `entity_ids: ['__location__']`. The schema is correct in PISTON_FORMAT.md — the code doesn't
  match it. Compiler will fail silently for all location commands until this is fixed.
  Files: `wizard-action.js`.

**Ordering:** GAP-S75-1 and GAP-S75-2 can be coded together (same session — they share the
help endpoint and the debug panel). GAP-S75-3 depends on W-S18 being done first (needs the
backend to be setting `compile_target`). GAP-S75-4 folds into the same session as GAP-S75-1/2.
GAP-S75-5 is small and can be done in any session that opens wizard-action.js.

---

## W-S20 — Help Content (writing session — no code)

Write the default content for all help markdown files. This is a writing session, not a
coding session. The files ship with PistonCore at the path `/pistoncore-userdata/help/`.

**Files to write:**
- `overview.md` — what PistonCore is, how it relates to WebCoRE and HA
- `getting_started.md` — building your first piston, step by step
- `statements.md` — what each statement type does (plain English, not spec language)
- `conditions.md` — operators explained, triggers vs conditions, was vs stays
- `variables.md` — piston variables vs global variables, how they work
- `pyscript.md` — what PyScript is, why some pistons need it, how to install via HACS,
  which features require it, what the user sees, how to update the threshold file
- `compiler.md` — what compile means, native vs PyScript, the debug screen explained,
  how to read compile output and warnings
- `troubleshooting.md` — common problems and fixes

**These files must be plain English — written for a non-technical home automation user,
not for a developer.** Jeremy reviews and approves content before shipping.

## W-S17 — Must-Work Wizard Features Spec  ← SPEC PARTIALLY DONE (Session 73)

These are not nice-to-haves. They are core to real pistons. Walking the alarm piston
surfaced all of these as hard blockers.

**Session 73 update:** The with-block / task container is now specced authoritatively in
**WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md** (the framework holds ALL WebCoRE task types; only Jeremy's
pistons' commands get implemented). PISTON_FORMAT/STATEMENT_TYPES/WIZARD_SPEC reconciled to
the code. The structure decision is made: a with-block is an `action` node + ordered
`tasks[]`; each task carries its picker category (device / location/virtual) as the
discriminator (the picker already knows it at selection time). GAP-S72-1 is also CODED
(see W-S15). The remaining W-S17 items below still need their wizard PATHS built.

### Multi-task with-blocks (GAP-S72-1) ✅ SPEC DONE + CODED (Session 73)
Specced in WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md; coded in W-S15. Remaining: the per-task DELETE
path (framework spec §3.3) and the picker pre-fill (GAP-S72-1b). Verify once picker works.

### Aggregation bar — v1 scope decision (D-S5d continuation session)
WebCoRE's aggregation picker has 12 options: Any, All, Average, Count, Least, Max, Median,
Min, Most, Stdev, Sum, Variance (VERIFIED — WEBCORE_WIZARD_MAP.md Part 8). PistonCore v1
implements Any / All / None only — the extended numeric aggregations (Average, Min, Max,
Count, etc.) are deferred to v2. This is a deliberate scope cut, documented in WIZARD_SPEC.md
v2.9. When v2 numeric aggregation is built, the compiler will need Jinja2 template equivalents
for each aggregation function against the entity_ids array.

### Wait (GAP-S72-2)
`wait` must be buildable as a first-class duration, including variable duration
(`Wait {integer_Lock_Confirm_Wait} seconds`). STATEMENT_TYPES §14 now flags wait-duration
as needing an operand (literal OR variable). Must work from the statement picker AND as an
in-block virtual task (framework spec §2.4 duality).
- JSON: `{ type: "wait", duration: {type:"variable", name:"$varname"}, duration_unit: "seconds" }`

### Volume set with variable (GAP-S72-3)
`volume_level` in HA is 0.0–1.0; WebCoRE used 0–100. Wizard must accept a variable as the
volume value (operand, per framework spec §5.3) and the compiler handles the 0–100 → 0.0–1.0
conversion (compiler concern, deferred to D-S6).

### TTS / Play media with composed message (GAP-S71-4 — carried forward)
Build a TTS / play_media action targeting a media_player global, composing spoken text from
literals + variables. See SPEAK_ACTION_SPEC.md (authoritative for the Speak task) — its
PROPOSED field names are now answerable against the reconciled PISTON_FORMAT task schema.

### Set variable with expression (GAP-S72-4)
Set variable nodes using string concatenation (`$DoorsOpen = $DoorsOpen + " " + $contact`)
must be buildable. JSON supports it (`value.type: "expression"`, STATEMENT_TYPES §13); the
wizard path doesn't exist. Also available as an in-block virtual task.

### Command picker rename-map (GAP-S73-3 — decision needs a home + a code home)
WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md principle 6 says a NARROW set of commands gets a user-facing
rename in the picker (visible label ≠ WebCoRE name) because the WebCoRE name points to
something that doesn't exist for the HA user. Settled renames so far: "Set Hubitat Safety
Monitor status" → HA alarm action; "Send an IFTTT Maker event" → **"Webhook"**. **Open
question:** WHERE does this rename map live in code, and where in the spec is the
authoritative list? The picker is populated from the WebCoRE command list (framework §5);
nothing yet specifies a rename layer between that list and the displayed label. A coding
session must (a) decide the rename-map's home (likely a small lookup applied at picker render),
and (b) the authoritative rename list needs a spec home — Jeremy picks each replacement name,
not Claude (principle 6). Until then the map is two entries living only in principle 6.

**Files for these items:** WIZARD_SPEC.md, STATEMENT_TYPES.md, PISTON_FORMAT.md,
WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md, SPEAK_ACTION_SPEC.md, wizard-action.js, wizard-statement.js,
wizard-loops.js, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

## W-S12 — v1 Retirement + Load Safety

Clean-slate the storage so testing isn't polluted by half-migrated files.

**Files:** editor.js, wizard-core.js, PISTON_FORMAT.md, DESIGN.md, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

- **GAP-S69-1:** logic_version 1 is retired — reject any piston without `logic_version: 2`
  with a clear message. Remove lazy per-node migration. Delete all existing v1 pistons from
  sandbox userdata; start fresh.
- **GAP-S69-2 (BLOCKER — RE-POINTED Session 74):** editing certain nodes errors out / fails
  to update. Original hypothesis (v1 nodes missing `role_tokens`/`entity_ids` on hydrate)
  may still apply to leftover v1 data, but the Session 74 audit found a CURRENT-FORMAT
  cause that matches the symptom and will NOT self-resolve: editing any top-level
  trigger/condition routes through `_commitCondition`'s else branch and creates a duplicate
  if-block instead of updating the original (full trace in W-S18 / GAP-S74-1 item 4).
  Treat GAP-S69-2 as closed-by-W-S18 unless a distinct in-block edit failure reproduces
  after W-S18 lands. **Needs at session time (if it reproduces):** the actual
  console/network error.
- **GAP-S69-3:** `_normalizePiston` (editor.js ~96-114) silently `splice`s malformed nodes —
  permanent silent data loss, violates the render invariant. Fix: leave the node, flag it,
  show `⚠ Unknown statement [id] — edit to repair`.

---

## W-S13 — Editor / Wizard Cleanup

Small, low-risk items grouped so they don't each burn a session.

**Files:** editor.js, wizard-core.js, WIZARD_SPEC.md, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

- **GAP-S58-2:** Copy/paste/duplicate statements (also MISSING_SPECS Item 26). The anchor item.
- **GAP-S69-4 (rides on GAP-S58-2) — NARROWED Session 74:** `_deepReId` (editor.js ~1008)
  now DOES cover `conditions[]` and `tasks[]` (~1023–1024) — do not re-fix those. Still
  missing: `until_conditions` (repeat blocks) and `else_ifs[].conditions` (the else_ifs
  handler re-IDs `eib.id` and `eib.statements` only). Copy/paste leaves those IDs stale.
- **GAP-S74-6 (LOW, NEW Session 74):** `only_on_days` encoding is inconsistent between
  builders: the condition builder writes ISO 1–7 Monday-first (wizard-condition.js ~76,
  `value="${i+1}"` — matches spec) but the timer/`every` builder writes 0–6
  (wizard-loops.js ~352, `value="${i}"`). Pin ISO 1–7 everywhere (one-character fix in
  wizard-loops + hydrate compatibility for any existing `every` nodes) so the compiler gets
  one encoding. Files: wizard-loops.js, STATEMENT_TYPES.md (§9 every).
- **GAP-S74-7 (decision made D-S5d session) — RETIRE `list_role`:** Jeremy chose Option (a):
  honor the original Session 57 retirement. `list_role` is a duplicate of `role` and will be
  removed. The four active code sites (wizard-loops.js ~136/~146, editor.js ~390–393,
  status.js ~201, wizard-core.js ~684, wizard-statement.js ~98) must migrate to `role`.
  B-2 residue sweep should treat `list_role` as genuine residue. STATEMENT_TYPES.md §6
  already correctly omits it (no spec change needed — spec was right all along).
  Files: wizard-loops.js, editor.js, status.js, wizard-core.js, wizard-statement.js.
- **GAP-S69-6:** Remove dead `Editor.getDeviceMap()` export (editor.js ~1385). grep for callers
  first; if any exist they're using retired v1 thinking and need review.
- **GAP-S69-7:** `_sel = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(editNode))` (wizard-core.js ~515) lets legacy
  fields (`list_role`, `devices`, old `device_map` refs) persist through an edit round-trip.
  Fix: build the commit output node from scratch using only spec-defined fields for the node type.
- **GAP-S69-8 (low):** `_groupDevices` uses "shortest friendly_name wins" — non-deterministic
  for equal-length names.
- **GAP-D5d-1 (INVESTIGATE — unassigned):** After a user saves a device define variable,
  nodes that reference that variable should update their entity_ids automatically without
  requiring the user to reopen and re-commit each wizard. `_reResolveVariableUses` may
  already handle this — investigate before coding anything. If it doesn't work correctly,
  the fix lives in editor.js / wizard-core.js. Assign to whichever coding session loads
  those files.

---

## W-S14 — Import Fixes

All import-path work grouped together.

**Files:** editor.js, list.js, api.py, PISTON_FORMAT.md, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

- **GAP-S46-5:** Import modal is paste-only — add a file picker.
- **GAP-S68-1:** Import mapper shows raw entity_ids instead of friendly names.
- **GAP-S68-2:** Import role mapping does not populate defines `initial_value`.
- **GAP-S46-4 (G-3):** Imported globals land in piston variables instead of the globals store.
- **GAP-S71-3 (import role-mapping dialog never fires) — ROOT CAUSE FOUND Session 74:**
  The entire import step-2 flow in list.js is still built on the retired `device_map` model:
  unmapped roles are detected from `saved.device_map` (~325), which the Session 71 backend
  no longer returns — so `unmapped` is always empty and the dialog can never fire. Worse,
  the Continue handler writes `device_map` back onto the piston via savePiston (~396–404),
  re-introducing the retired field if it ever did fire. The fix is not "make the dialog
  fire" — it is REBUILDING step 2 against the v2 model per DESIGN 6.11: detect unmapped
  from nodes with `role`/`role_tokens` and empty `entity_ids` (walk statements + the three
  top-level arrays), and on Continue write resolved entity_ids onto those NODES (and
  friendly names into defines per GAP-S68-2), never a map. Found Session 71; diagnosed
  Session 74. Files: list.js (primary), editor.js, api.py.

---

## W-S16 — Visual / Display-Only Gaps (parked, non-blocking)

- **GAP-S70-2:** `_condLine` does not render `display_value` for some operators — editor shows
  `{Illuminance} is less than or equal to` with no `800`. Value IS saved correctly in JSON.
- **GAP-S74-9 (LOW render defects, NEW Session 74):**
  (a) editor.js ~229 reads `p.updated_at` but the wrapper field is `modified_at` — the
  "Modified" comment line always renders blank.
  (b) task render reads undocumented `task.service` before `task.command` (editor.js ~379) —
  dead/legacy first branch; nothing writes `service`.
  (c) define render reads `initial_device_names` FIRST with a comment calling it the model
  (editor.js ~244–249) — backwards per PISTON_FORMAT (initial_value is the model;
  initial_device_names is never written). Harmless fallback order; fix the comment and
  prefer `initial_value`.
- **(add visual items here as found)**

---

## STAGE G — Globals (remaining)

- **G-4 / GAP-S57-5:** Global device edit → redeploy prompt + batch entity_id update across
  all pistons referencing the changed global.
  **Design decision (Session 72):** Two viable approaches —
  (a) **Scan on demand** — at redeploy time, backend walks all piston JSON files, finds
      `role_tokens` containing `@GlobalName`, re-resolves entity_ids, saves. Simple, always
      correct, no drift. Fine at current scale (dozens of pistons).
  (b) **Indexed used_by list** — store `used_by: ["uuid1","uuid2"]` on each global object.
      Drift healed by inventory pass on editor load (and optionally on a timer). Faster lookup
      at scale. More moving parts but all within PistonCore's own files.
  **Decide at G-4 session time** based on piston library size at that point.
  **Files:** globals.js, api.py, wizard-core.js, editor.js, DESIGN.md, WIZARD_SPEC.md,
  CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

---

## STAGE B — Backend Compiler  (BLOCKED until the wizard round-trip works)

**Do not start STAGE B until the alarm piston (or an equivalent real piston) builds AND
round-trips cleanly through the wizard.** The wizard gaps in W-S14/W-S15/W-S17 come first.

### B-1: compiler.py — Entity IDs Direct Read + MISSING_ENTITY Validation
**Blocked** per the stage note above.

**What to implement:**
1. Remove all `device_map` / `list_role` lookup from compiler.py.
2. Read `entity_ids` directly from condition, action, for_each nodes, and the top-level
   triggers/conditions/restrictions arrays.
3. Implement `resolve_entities()` per COMPILER_SPEC.md Section 8.
4. Add `MISSING_ENTITY` compiler error (COMPILER_SPEC.md Section 13).
5. Entity validation as Stage 2 in pre-deploy pipeline (Section 15).
6. Multi-entity triggers/actions: pass entity_ids array directly (no expansion).
7. for_each: write entity_ids list inline (no lookup).

**Reference:** PISTON_FORMAT.md v2.4, STATEMENT_TYPES.md v2.3, SAMPLE_PISTONS.md
(⚠ SAMPLE_PISTONS is old-format until D-S5d regenerates it — see D-S5d item 4).
**Note:** COMPILER_SPEC.md is intentionally STALE (see D-S6). Treat its content as directional
only; PISTON_FORMAT.md + STATEMENT_TYPES.md + REFERENCE_PISTON_V2.json are authoritative.
**Files:** compiler.py, context_builder.py, COMPILER_SPEC.md, PISTON_FORMAT.md,
STATEMENT_TYPES.md, REFERENCE_PISTON_V2.json, SAMPLE_PISTONS.md, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

### B-2: Full v1-Residue Audit — BACKEND + FRONTEND  (do with or before B-1; expanded Session 74)
Backend (original scope): grep every backend `.py` (context_builder.py, ha_client.py,
main.py, compiler.py, utils.py) for `device_map`, `list_role`, `logic_version` defaults of
1, and any other v1-model assumptions. storage.py already confirmed clean (Session 71).
**Frontend (NEW Session 74 — the audit found the residue is NOT backend-only):**
- **GAP-S74-8 (stale-comment cluster — these comments assert the OPPOSITE of the
  load-bearing rule and will mislead any session that reads them as truth):**
  api.js `createGlobal`/`updateGlobal` ("value is an array of entity ID strings" — twice)
  and `importPiston` ("device_map may be empty..."); globals.js header (~lines 7–9, "device
  value: array of entity_id strings") and `_renderDevicePicker` intro (~233); 
  wizard-variable.js header ("G-2b: Device initial value stores array of entity_id
  strings"); wizard-action.js header ("physical device row → primary_entity_id" —
  contradicts the sel.tokens HARD GUARDRAIL in its own file). Fix = rewrite the comments to
  state the friendly-name model; zero behavior change.
- editor.js `getDeviceMap()` dead export (GAP-S69-6, W-S13 — coordinate, don't double-fix).
- list.js import flow (GAP-S71-3, W-S14 — coordinate).
- status.js `_exportPiston` snapshot path (GAP-S74-4, S2-3 — coordinate).
- `list_role` is NOT residue — see GAP-S74-7 decision before grepping it out.
**Files:** all backend *.py, api.js, globals.js, wizard-variable.js, wizard-action.js,
editor.js, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

---

## STAGE D — Spec (remaining)

### D-S5c: Leftover Audit Findings (spec cleanup — not yet applied)
- **Finding 7 ✅ CONFIRMED APPLIED (Session 69c, verified D-S5d):** DESIGN.md v1.8 contains
  the four reopen criteria — confirmed against the actual file this session. D-S5c was wrong
  to list it as not yet applied.
- **Finding 12:** `compile_target` is a cache, not a user preference — document in PISTON_FORMAT.md.
- **Finding 15:** Test button always fires real actions — deferred v2 dry-run feature, recorded.
- **Pattern B ✅ CONFIRMED APPLIED (Session 69c, verified D-S5d):** DESIGN.md v1.8 contains
  the authoritative preamble at Section 6 with 6.2/6.3 as confirmed pointers. D-S5c was wrong
  to list it as not yet applied.
- **§10-a ✅ RESOLVED (Session 73):** "Set location mode → input_select" researched live and
  confirmed (input_select.select_option + state-trigger); now in §10.1 as verified.
- **§10-b ✅ RESOLVED (Session 73):** §10.1 now has a column-meaning note distinguishing
  "HA doc read this session" from "Existing path" (already-in-code).
- **§10-c ✅ RESOLVED (Session 73):** LIFX researched — native effect actions exist
  (lifx.effect_pulse w/ modes, effect_colorloop, effect_move, set_state; scenes via
  select.select_option). LIFX is REPRODUCIBLE, moved to §10.1, removed from cut list.
- **§10-d ✅ RESOLVED (Session 73):** §10.4 now states plainly that "reproducible" = the HA
  action exists, NOT end-to-end behavior-tested (scene.create unavailable-entity quirk cited);
  real-HA testing still advised before v1.
- **§10 status:** non-device command research is COMPLETE for wizard load — no open items.
  The only remaining real-HA *testing* (not research) is end-to-end behavior verification of
  the §10.1 mappings, which belongs in Stage 3, not here.
**Files:** DESIGN.md, PISTON_FORMAT.md, HA_LIMITATIONS.md, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

### D-S5d: Spec Corrections from the Session 74 Audit ✅ COMPLETE (D-S5d session)

All ten items worked through and applied. Summary of what was done:
1. CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md — W-S11 claim downgraded to conditions/for_each only (GAP-S74-2 is the actions gap); Session 73 review note removed; command classification updated to COMPLETE.
2. PENDING→COMPLETE sweep applied: CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md §4 heading/blockquote/§7; garbled §6 item 6 sentence fixed.
3. PISTON_FORMAT.md — Complete Minimal Example fixed (trigger in top-level `triggers[]`, not nested in if); "four→five documents" fixed; Field Lifecycle table notes added for Snapshot strip behavior (verify before implementing — role_tokens strip may erase authored content). STATEMENT_TYPES.md §14 duration_unit fixed to full words; time condition schema fixed to match code's flat shape (role:"time", no subject field, GAP-S74-5).
4. SAMPLE_PISTONS.md — **STILL NEEDS NOTICE** (file not uploaded this session). Add prominent FROZEN/STALE notice at top manually or upload next spec session. Content stays untouched; regenerate at D-S6.
5. S3-1 checklist — already fixed in TASKS.md Session 74; checklist only lives here, no other docs to update.
6. FRONTEND_SPEC.md — compile target removed from editor layout entirely (debug page only); "only when" restrictions section added between CONDITIONS and execute, matching WebCoRE; with-block task model section added reflecting coded-but-unverified state.
7. Housekeeping — PROGRESS_TRACKER.md and COMPILER_SPEC_STALE_NOTICE.md confirmed deleted. WIZARD_SPEC.md version pin updated v2.2→v2.4.
8. PISTON_FORMAT.md Field Lifecycle table — verification notes added to role_tokens, entity_ids, compiled_value Snapshot rows; strip behavior flagged as needing verification before implementation.
9. D-S5c Finding 7 and Pattern B — confirmed applied in Session 69c; D-S5c corrected.
10. HA_LIMITATIONS.md §10.2 — clarifying note added explaining why automation.turn_off/on doesn't qualify as pause/resume (ASSUMED — mid-run state distinction).

**New gap filed this session:** Investigate whether `_reResolveVariableUses` handles rehydration of node entity_ids after a define variable is saved, without requiring the user to reopen and re-commit each wizard. Assign to whichever coding session loads `_reResolveVariableUses` and editor.js.

**Spec consolidation completed this session (Goal 2):**
- PISTON_FORMAT.md v2.5 — absorbs STATEMENT_TYPES.md v2.3; single source of truth for all piston JSON schemas. STATEMENT_TYPES.md retired to /reference.
- WIZARD_SPEC.md v2.8 — absorbs WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md + editor rendering rules from FRONTEND_SPEC.md. WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md retired to /reference.
- FRONTEND_SPEC.md v1.6 — editor/wizard content removed; now covers screens/chrome only.
- WEBCORE_WIZARD_MAP.md added to repo — verified extraction of WebCoRE wizard surface from source (June 2026). Incorporated into WIZARD_SPEC.md as the "Verified WebCoRE Wizard Reference" section (statement card set, properties panel, dialog-edit-task layout, operand widget input types + visibility, comparison widget structure, restriction warning, render order, operator-list gap). WEBCORE_WIZARD_MAP.md retained in repo as the full-detail source. Flexible language used throughout — WebCoRE is the baseline PistonCore adapts from, not a rigid contract.
- SAMPLE_PISTONS.md FROZEN/STALE notice — **still needs to be added manually**.

### D-S6: Compiler Spec Rewrite (after JSON structure is final)
COMPILER_SPEC.md and PYSCRIPT_COMPILER_SPEC.md intentionally FROZEN/STALE. Rewrite after
W-S11 + B-1 prove the round-trip and JSON format stops moving.
**Files:** COMPILER_SPEC.md, PYSCRIPT_COMPILER_SPEC.md, HA_LIMITATIONS.md, PISTON_FORMAT.md,
REFERENCE_PISTON_V2.json, CLAUDE_SESSION_PROMPT.md, TASKS.md

---

## STAGE 2 — Connect the Seams (after round-trip works)

- **S2-2:** GAP-S38-1 (/api/logs route missing), GAP-S39-1 (ha_client import pattern wrong)
- **S2-3:** GAP-S43-4 (Snapshot export), GAP-S58-3 (piston backup/restore)
  - **GAP-S74-4 (MED, NEW Session 74 — fold into GAP-S43-4):** the current Snapshot export
    (status.js `_exportPiston`, ~491–505) is still v1: it empties `device_map` values and
    strips NOTHING else. Per PISTON_FORMAT's Field Lifecycle table, Snapshot must strip
    `role_tokens`, `entity_ids`, and `compiled_value` (keep `role`, `display_value`,
    `aggregation`). Today's "snapshots" are full backups with a label — they leak the
    user's entity_ids, which defeats the share/anonymize purpose. The lifecycle table's
    "Stripped" column is currently aspirational; either fix the export here or mark the
    table rows "TARGET — not yet implemented" until S2-3 lands (D-S5d item 8).

---

## STAGE 3 — Round-Trip Verification

### S3-1: Smoke Test — Full Round-Trip on One Simple Piston
Prerequisites: W-S11, W-S12, W-S14, W-S15, W-S17, **W-S18 (Session 74 — the wizard cannot
write top-level triggers without it)**, B-1, G-4 complete.
Success = all seven checklist items at top of file.

### S3-2: Deferred Validation Testing (after S3-1)
- GAP-S33-2: condition_and/or template indentation — real-world testing
- Sunrise/sunset negative offset edge cases
- Numeric trigger unknown-state behavior
- Single-device missing-entity behavior

---

## STAGE 4 — Features (only after Stage 3)

- **S4-16:** GAP-S30-3 (double config load), GAP-S34-1, GAP-S47-1 (cosmetic)
- **S4-17:** MISSING_SPECS Item 25 (entity state subscription vs polling)
- **Post-S3 polish:** audit `_esc()` coverage; self-host Google Fonts; CSP; ARIA pass.

---

## DEFERRED

- **GAP-S63-1:** Domain priority investigation — not blocking anything.
- **D-1 through D-9:** See TASKS_HISTORY.md (unchanged).
- **MISSING_SPECS Item 11 (partial):** post-S3-2, production sample pistons.
- **MISSING_SPECS Item 12:** post-S3-1, write BEST_PRACTICES.md.
- **MISSING_SPECS Item 15:** before S4-10, write-a-piston.md prompt content.
- **AI_PROMPT_SPEC.md** stale (old device_map model) — rewrite before any AI-import work.
- **GAP-S70-1:** MOVED to W-S15 (Session 74) — verification done from code; it is a defect.
- **GAP-S50-1:** carry-forward from W-S11.

---

## JSON SCAFFOLD DECISIONS — Forward Compatibility

These are features cut from v1 that are deliberately scaffolded into the JSON now so future
versions require no migration. The data structure is locked; only the UI gate and compiler
path need to be built later.

**Standing design principle (D-S5d continuation session):** For any feature cut from v1,
the preferred pattern is: scaffold the JSON field(s) now (empty arrays / null defaults),
show the UI element in the editor but locked/grayed with a clear "not available in v1"
label, block insertion via a modal notice rather than hiding the UI entirely, and emit a
passive informational notice on the debug/compile page if the field is non-empty. This
keeps the JSON stable, gives users visibility into what's coming, and makes v2
implementation a matter of removing the gate — not restructuring anything.

### SCAFFOLD-1: when_true / when_false on condition nodes

**Decision (D-S5d continuation session):** WebCoRE supports `when true` / `when false`
inline statement blocks on individual conditions — a list of actions that fire immediately
when that specific condition evaluates, before the parent if/then/else continues. This is
a power-user feature with no native HA Script equivalent (PyScript only). Cut from v1
wizard and compiler. Scaffolded now for forward compatibility.

**JSON scaffold:** Every condition node gets two optional arrays:
```json
{
  "when_true": [],
  "when_false": []
}
```
Default: empty arrays. Written by the wizard as empty on every new condition node.
Compiler silently skips empty arrays. Round-trip preserves them.

**Editor behavior (v1):**
- Render `when true` and `when false` as collapsible blocks below each condition line,
  matching WebCoRE's visual exactly — but with a lock icon and grayed appearance.
- Clicking `+ add a statement` inside either block shows a modal:
  "When True / When False blocks are not available in v1 — planned for a future release."
  No statement is added. Block collapses back. JSON field stays empty.
- If a future imported piston somehow has non-empty `when_true`/`when_false` arrays,
  render the statements as grayed/locked rows so they are visible but clearly inactive.

**Debug/compile page (v1):**
- If either array is non-empty, show a passive informational banner (not an error):
  "This piston contains When True / When False blocks. These will not execute until a
  future version enables them."
- Only shown when non-empty — silent for all v1-built pistons.

**Release documentation note:** `when_true` / `when_false` are intentionally present in
the JSON schema as forward-compatibility scaffolding. They are visible in the editor but
not functional in v1. This is a deliberate design choice so existing pistons require no
migration when the feature is enabled in a future release.

**Implementation scope when ready (future session):**
- Remove the modal gate in the editor
- Wire the `+ add a statement` ghost text to the existing statement insertion path
- Add compiler handling (PyScript only — forces PyScript compile target)
- Update HA_LIMITATIONS.md and COMPILER_SPEC.md
- Files: editor.js, PISTON_FORMAT.md (already scaffolded), COMPILER_SPEC.md, HA_LIMITATIONS.md

## Session 74 Notes — Code↔Spec Audit (what was checked and confirmed GOOD)

So the next session doesn't re-verify what's already traced:
- **GAP-S72-1 fix is present and coherent** across editor.js (task-owner attr, ~383,
  ~721–727) → wizard-core.js (`_route` edit-by-task-id, ~642–651) → wizard-action.js
  (`_saveDeviceCmd` CASE 1/2/3 append/replace-by-id, ~800–841; Add-more re-targets the
  same block, ~843–861). Still untestable end-to-end until GAP-S73-2.
- **`_globalsCache` strip/restore** in editor.js `save()` (~1265–1268) — correct.
- **sel.tokens hard guardrail** (physical rows store ALL entity_ids) implemented in the
  action, condition, and for_each pickers.
- **Union-then-intersect** implemented including per-field intersection across groups
  (wizard-action.js ~624–664).
- **Operator vocabularies, LOCATION_COMMANDS, statement-type cards** match
  WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK §5.1/§5.4/§5.6 exactly.
- **GAP-S69-3** (normalize splices), **GAP-S69-6** (getDeviceMap), **GAP-S69-7** (_sel deep
  copy), **GAP-S69-8** (shortest-name label) — all still present exactly as filed.
- NOT re-verified: GAP-S45-1 (left as filed).

## Session 72 Notes

- **Test vehicle:** `claude_alarm_checks_faithful.json` — faithful structural alarm piston copy.
  Devices are role placeholders (`entity_ids: []`). Use this to walk the wizard.
- **Old globals (entity_ids in value field):** test/lights/lumin_sensor/lock/Notifications_Push
  still store entity_ids instead of friendly names — pre-fix data. Edit them manually via the
  globals panel to correct. NOTE (Session 73): `@Speakers` was switched off the broken Sonos
  to a ReSpeaker; resolution still failed (GAP-S73-2). An HA update broke the Sonos
  `media_player` entity feed. The pre-fix-globals cleanup and GAP-S73-1 (can't remove a
  missing device) compound each other.
- **`_globalsCache` in saved JSON:** fixed Session 72 (editor.js restores cache after save
  response, preventing it from accumulating on `_piston` and leaking to disk).
- **volume_set 0–100 vs HA 0.0–1.0:** conversion concern logged in W-S17 (GAP-S72-3).

## Spec File Versions (after Session 73)
- DESIGN.md **v1.8**
- PISTON_FORMAT.md **v2.4** (Session 73 — task model: device/non-device tasks, picker
  category as discriminator (storage is a coding-time choice), order)
- WIZARD_SPEC.md **v2.7** (Session 73 — W-6 task append/edit/delete + virtual-in-block flows)
- STATEMENT_TYPES.md **v2.3** (Session 73 — task schema device/virtual, wait/set_var duality)
- WITH_BLOCK_TASK_FRAMEWORK.md **v1.0 (NEW, Session 73)** — authoritative task-container spec
- FRONTEND_SPEC.md **v1.5**
- HA_LIMITATIONS.md — Section 3 corrected; **non-device command classification COMPLETE
  (Session 73, §10, vs HA 2026.6)** — remaining work is real-HA behavior *testing* (Stage 3)
  and `target-boundary.json` existence verification (UNVERIFIED — confirm in code or create)
- COMPILER_SPEC.md **v1.5 — FROZEN/STALE** (see D-S6 — do not touch until v1 JSON locks)
- PYSCRIPT_COMPILER_SPEC.md — **FROZEN/STALE** (see D-S6)
- SAMPLE_PISTONS.md v1.0
- AI_PROMPT_SPEC.md v2.0 (stale — old device_map model; FROZEN until v1 JSON locks)
- REFERENCE_PISTON_V2.json — v2 diff anchor
- SPEAK_ACTION_SPEC.md / NOTIFY_ACTION_SPEC.md — ledgered; PROPOSED field names now
  answerable against reconciled PISTON_FORMAT task schema (optional light reconciliation later)
- COMPILER_DECISIONS_HOLDING.md **v1.0 (NEW, Session 73)** — holds the at-risk SPEAK/NOTIFY
  compiler decisions until D-S6 folds them into COMPILER_SPEC; retire then
- BACKEND_SPEC_PROTO.md **v0.1 (NEW, Session 73)** — PROTO research-gathering for the add-on/
  backend phase (parked, builds when STAGE B unblocks). Verified findings so far: Shortumation
  add-on config.yaml + Dockerfile + WebSocket HA client (`hass-websocket-client`, with
  `fetch_services()` covering NOTIFY's service-registry need); issue-#115 file-vs-WS lesson.
  Research queue: HomeAssistantEditor, TimeMachine, addon-vscode, re-verify Shortumation vs
  current HA add-on docs.

### Session 73 output files — review status
Review COMPLETE. See the "✅ SESSION 73 OUTPUT REVIEW — DONE" block above. Code files
(editor.js, wizard-core.js, wizard-action.js) traced and verified; spec files reconciled
to code and safe to treat as reference.

## Reminder for Jeremy
At the end of each session: move fully-completed gaps/bundles to TASKS_HISTORY.md, roll
partial-fix remainders forward into their group, and assign any new gaps that came up during
testing to the right group. Tell Claude to do the history offload — it won't happen automatically.
